Menial_Labour_Simulator
=======================

A tree rotation game completed by myself and Nick Frosst using starter code written by Prof. Paul Gries.

The code required to open the pygame window and highlight a number was written by the Prof. Gries. The game mechanics, scoring, introduction, key detection and tree reotation were written by myself and Nick Frosst.

To run the game, several python modules are required such as pygame. I will update this readme with a list of such modules.
